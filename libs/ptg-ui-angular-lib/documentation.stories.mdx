Storybook is a development environment tool that is used as a playground for UI components. It allows us, the developers, to 
create and test components in isolation. It runs outside of the app, too, so project dependencies won't affect the behaviour of
components.


Adding Storybook to an Angular project is pretty straight-forward.With Storybook you create stories for your components. 
Each story shows the behavior for a single component with specific states set.


Browse the stories in the sidebar menu to know the different Angular components and see usage examples for every component.

Looking for a specific component? You can use the search bar or just press '/' and start typing.
