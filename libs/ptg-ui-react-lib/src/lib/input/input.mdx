# Input Component

 ---

The HTML input element is primarily to create HTML forms. In other words, an HTML `<input>` tag is used to create the data fields on forms that enable users to enter information. 

We can import the input tag using the following importation : 

```
    import { PtgUiInput } from ' @ptg-ui/react'
```    

Types of controls supported by input:

 - placeholder
 - id
 - required
 - disabled
 - name
 - input size
 - value




 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a input using the following HTML Tag: 


```

```

Following a are some controls with their values :

1] placeholder :

The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g. a sample value or a short description of the expected format).

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

Note: The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.

<Canvas of={PtgUiInputs.Placeholder}/>       


2] id : 

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

<Canvas of={PtgUiInputs.Id}/>


3] required : 

The required attribute is a boolean attribute.

When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

The required attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file.

4] disabled :

The disabled attribute is a boolean attribute.

When present, it specifies that the input should be disabled.

A disabled input is unusable and un-clickable.

Disabled control have two values -  

true - The button is disabled

false - Default. The button is not disabled

<Canvas of={PtgUiInputs.Disabled} />   


5] name :

The name attribute specifies a name for an HTML element. This name attribute can be used to reference the element in a application. 

For a `<form>` element, the name attribute is used as a reference when the data is submitted. 

For an `<iframe>` element, the name attribute can be used to target a form submission.

<Canvas of={PtgUiInputs.Name} />  


6] input size : 

Input size control is used to set the size for an input element. 

We can set the sm , md and lg size for the an input element .   

sm means small , md means medium and lg means large .

<Canvas of={PtgUiInputs.InputSize} />

The value attribute specifies the value of an  element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
